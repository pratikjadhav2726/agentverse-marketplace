# Enterprise AI Agent Marketplace - Documentation

## Overview

Welcome to the comprehensive documentation for the Enterprise AI Agent Marketplace project. This repository contains all the technical documentation, implementation guides, architecture specifications, and team resources needed to build and maintain a world-class AI agent marketplace platform.

## Vision Statement

The Enterprise AI Agent Marketplace transforms the way organizations leverage artificial intelligence by creating a dynamic ecosystem where AI agents function as a collaborative "company," replacing or augmenting traditional departments. By integrating Agent2Agent (A2A) and Model Context Protocol (MCP), we enable unprecedented agent collaboration, scalability, and enterprise-level security.
